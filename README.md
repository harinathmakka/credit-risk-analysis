# Credit Risk Analysis for Loan Applicants

## Project Overview
Banks and financial institutions face the challenge of evaluating whether a loan applicant is likely to be approved or rejected.  
This project uses **SQL** for data cleaning and exploration and **Power BI** for visualization to provide insights into loan approval trends and applicant risk profiles.

The goal is to demonstrate strong **data analysis, SQL, and reporting skills** in the BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, Insurance) domain.

## Tech Stack
- **SQL (MySQL Workbench)** â†’ Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis  
- **Power BI Service** â†’ Interactive dashboards and reports  
- **CSV** â†’ Initial dataset

## Dashboard Preview
The interactive dashboards were built in Power BI Service and exported as PDF.  
You can view them here:  

ðŸ‘‰ [Loan Approval Dashboard (PDF)](credit_risk_analysis_HM.pdf)

## Key Insights
- **Overall Loan Approval Rate** â€” What percentage of applicants were approved  
- **Credit History Impact** â€” Strong influence on approval likelihood  
- **Income Band Trends** â€” Relationship between applicant income and approvals  
- **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Segments** â€” Risk distribution by repayment capacity  
- **Property Area & Dependents** â€” Approval variation across demographic factors  
- **KPI Cards** â€” Total applications, approval percentage, average loan amount

## How to Reproduce
1. Load the raw dataset into SQL (scripts available in `project_credit_risk_analysis.sql`).  
2. Run preprocessing queries (handle NULLs, create new columns like `Total_Income`, `Income_Band`, `DTI_Band`).  
3. Export the cleaned dataset and load into Power BI.  
4. Recreate the visuals as per the documentation **or** view the exported PDF above.
